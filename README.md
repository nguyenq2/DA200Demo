# CS113: Final Project

For this project, you will implement the program that you proposed in your project groups.

Your program will need to meet the following requirements:

* Some form of user input (can be a file, an image, the user typing or clicking, input from buttons, potentiometers, or other inputs via the Pico etc.).
* Some form of output (a new file, a displayed image, an interactive UI, printed output, a plot, output via some device on the Pico, etc.).
* Perform some kind of logic beyond input and output
* Use a list, a dictionary, and/or loop somewhere
* Follow the structure and style guidelines from the book and previous projects. Functions should be well-used to divide the code up logically – if you have a function/method that is more than 10-20 lines of code, think about how you might simplify it. You must also have docstrings for each function you write and a docstring at the top of each file explaining what the file is for. **This is especially important since there is no template for this project!**
* Your program must execute correctly, and generate different results if given different input (or each time it's run, if randomness is involved).
* You must include unit tests for at least two of your functions in a separate testing module.

## Use of Advanced Programming Constructs and External Resources

For the final project you are allowed, **but not required**, to research and use advanced programming constructs and external libraries that extend or go beyond what we've covered in class. Whether you choose to do so or not, please abide by the following policy:
1. **All of the algorithms and code that you develop for your project should be your own work.** While it is acceptable to consult external resources to learn about a concept or tool you would like to use, your project should not be the product of following a tutorial. You should not copy code from external resources or generate it using an LLM tool.

2. Explain any new tools or techniques that you used, if any, in the *Implementation Details* section of your writeup, and acknowledge any external resources that helped you to learn about and integrate them into your project. For example, "We used the tkinter module to create a graphical interface for our project, which we learned about from the Python documentation (link/citation) and this tutorial (link/citation). Tkinter is..." or "We wrote our own Python class for a deck of cards, which we learned about from Chapter 12 of the textbook (citation)".  **You should cite at least one source for any advanced programming construct or tool beyond the course content that you use.**

Please consult with me if you have any questions about this policy with respect to your particular project.


## Deliverables
**A. A working implementation of your program (Submit on GitHub)** I have not given you any starter code. You should figure out a reasonable structure for your program and sync all of your files in this repository. Important! Please make sure your final code is properly pushed. Due to the end-of-semester timeline I will not have time to reach out and coordinate with you if your code is out of date or missing.

I should be able to run your program and your tests without ANY modifications to your code. How you structure your code and files is up to you, so long as you follow the requirements from above, e.g., you must have a separate testing module with your unit tests, as well as the course style and structure guidelines.


**B. Final presentation (Submit slides on Canvas)**
Each group will prepare a 7-10 minute presentation on their project to present during the final exam slot (December 14, 9:00-11:00am).
The presentation should include the following:
1. Overview of the project goals (what was the problem you set out to solve and why?)
2. Functional decomposition of the problem (how did you break the problem down into parts?)
3. Implementation details (how did you implement each of the parts?)
4. Demo (demonstrate your project working--have a backup video or slides just in case it doesn't work)
5. Evaluation (what went well, what are some limitations to what you built, how would you extend this in the future?)
6. Q & A

I would recommend having one slide for each of the components above. If you use any material from external sources in your slides, please cite your sources!

**C. A video explaining your system and demonstrating how to use it (Submit on Canvas)** Your video should be narrated and clearly explain what is going on. It is especially important to be detailed for this project, since your project is of your own invention. Make sure that the video makes sense to somebody who is not a part of your project team. You can use this as a backup in case the demo during your presentation doesn't work.


**D. Writeup (Submit on Canvas)**

Your writeup should be 2-3 pages and include the following sections. I encourage you to use diagrams and figures to illustrate what you built:
1. Overview of the Project Goals (what was the problem you set out to solve and why?)
2. Functional Decomposition of the problem (how did you break the problem down into parts?)
3. Implementation Details (how did you implement each of the parts?) **Make sure to describe any advanced programming constructs or external libraries that you used in this section** and cite at least one source that helped you learn about each. I reserve the right to deduct points if you use tools that go beyond the course content but do not describe them here.
4. **IMPORTANT!!! Detailed instructions on how to run your code**
5. Ethical Reflection (are there any ethical considerations related to your project?)
6. Accomplishments (what did you accomplish in your project that you are the most proud of?)
7. Team Reflections (what challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them? What is one thing you learned while doing this project?)
8. Acknowledgements (did you use any external resources to help you complete this project?)
9. Contribution Statement (how did each teammate contribute to the project?)

**E.** **Each team must check in with me at least one time in office hours or via an alternative arrangement to get feedback before the final submission of the project. Simply having this check-in will be worth 5% of your project grade!**
